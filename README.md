# StromGT - Electricity consumption of building services: A calculation tool for planners
- The electricity consumption of building automation (BA) has a relevant share in the total electricity consumption of building technology (BT). The new calculation tool «StromGT» presented here helps the planner to analyse the BA and BT power consumption. With little effort, the planner receives a realistic, detailed picture of the power consumption of the planned BA and BT system already in the early planning phases. By making changes to the system, consumption reductions can be identified.

- The tool name «StromGT» refers to the German topic name «Stromverbrauch der Gebäudetechnik».
