# StromGT - Electricity consumption of building services: A calculation tool for planners
- The electricity consumption of building automation (BA) has a relevant share in the total electricity consumption of building technology (BT). The new calculation tool _StromGT_ presented here helps the planner to analyse the BA and BT power consumption. With little effort, the planner receives a realistic, detailed picture of the power consumption of the planned BA and BT system already in the early planning phases. By making changes to the system, consumption reductions can be identified.

- The tool name _StromGT_ refers to the German topic name _**S**tromverbrauch der **G**eb√§ude**t**echnik.

- The tool ... 
      - can be used free of charge; 
      - is available in English, German and French;
      - was mainly financed by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy's _SwissEnergy_ programme.
