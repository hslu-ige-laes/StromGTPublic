# StromGT - Electricity consumption of building services: a calculation tool for planners
- The electricity consumption of building automation and control systems (BACS) has a relevant share in the total electricity consumption of building technology (BT). The calculation tool _StromGT_ presented here helps the planner to analyse the BACS and BT power consumption. With little effort, the planner receives a realistic, detailed picture of the power consumption of the planned BA and BT system already in the early planning phases. By making changes to the system, consumption reductions can be identified.

- The tool name _StromGT_ refers to the German topic name _**S**tromverbrauch der **G**eb√§ude**t**echnik_.

- StromGT is an Excel file-based tool. In order to use the tool, the system settings must allow execution of VBA code.
